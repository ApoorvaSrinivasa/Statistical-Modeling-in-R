# Statistical-Modeling-in-R
Stat-420 Course, Summer 2018

## About the project
There are many brew enthusiasts who like to brew beer at home. In order to make a good beer or to improve a recipe over many tries, it is essential to capture readings for several attributes during and after the brewing process. This requires one to buy costly sensors or measuring gadgets. Using Applied Statistics with R we wish to check if we can analyze and predict any of the attributes of beer, and hopefully suggest cost savings by eliminating any sensors or measuring gadgets for it. Further, we can even predict any attribute of the final product in the early stages of brewing process so that any tweaks can be made to the recipe based on the knowledge of the predictions of the final product.
